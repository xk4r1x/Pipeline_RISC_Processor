/*
 * Data Memory Module
 * 
 * This module implements the data memory subsystem for load and store operations.
 * It provides a word-addressable memory with 1024 32-bit words (4KB total).
 * The memory supports both read and write operations controlled by enable signals.
 * 
 * Inputs:
 *   - clk: Clock signal for synchronous writes
 *   - MemWrite: Enable signal for memory write operations
 *   - MemRead: Enable signal for memory read operations  
 *   - address[31:0]: Byte address for memory access
 *   - writeData[31:0]: Data to write to memory
 * 
 * Output:
 *   - readData[31:0]: Data read from memory
 * 
 * Memory Organization:
 *   - 1024 words Ã— 32 bits = 4096 bytes (4KB)
 *   - Word-aligned access (address bits [1:0] ignored)
 *   - Address range: 0x00000000 to 0x00000FFC (word addresses)
 * 
 * Operation:
 *   - Writes: Synchronous on positive clock edge when MemWrite=1
 *   - Reads: Combinational when MemRead=1, zero when MemRead=0
 *   - Address bounds checking prevents out-of-range access
